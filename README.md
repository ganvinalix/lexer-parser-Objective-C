# lexer-parser-Objective C
This repository contains lexer and parser code for Objective C language written in C language.
Parser used - Recursive Descent Parser
The file Report.pdf contains constructs,grammar and DFA for the project.

Sample Programs and their output:-
I have attached the sample test input files in the "Testfiles" folder and their corresponding output
generated by parser in "Snapshot" folder.

Parser Used:- Recursive Descent parser

Printing the output:- First you need to run the "lexer.c".It takes a sample program as a input file and
generate all the tokens, then run the "RecursiveDescentParser.c".It reads the output given by "lexer.c" 
one token at a time. When you run "parser.c", it prints the corresponding rule which is used for the 
reduction( basically printing the stack).
